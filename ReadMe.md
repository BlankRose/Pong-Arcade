</h1>

While this is the final project of the 42 cursus for our team, and despite none of us being much interested in web technologies, we are still proud to present our edition of the [original pong game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) released on the 29th of November 1972 by Atari.

This project is a collaborative work between 5 persons, and despite the hard time trying to get along all together sometimes, we still managed to bring this whole work together to the end of this journey. We split the work into two groups, one on the chat and the other on the game, and finally merged everything. As for who worked on the project, here's the shortlist with a link to our respective GitHub pages:
 - Rosie (https://github.com/BlankRose)
 - Pascal (https://github.com/wpf68)
 - Zharaa (https://github.com/zkansoun)
 - Charles (https://github.com/ulookme)
 - Maxime (https://github.com/Skellax)

----------------

While the provided subject was a bit restrictive, like how we had to use [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the backend and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database, we still had some free will on the way to complete this project.

For our project's front end, we decided to use [React](https://react.dev/) because of how everything is divided into components and its overall simplicity. As for the back end, we looked forward to [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) to ease out on the transactions with the database.

As for the website style, however, we decided to go very simple and minimalist, and somehow, it turned out quite well.
